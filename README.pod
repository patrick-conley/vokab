=head1 DESCRIPTION

The German department has a website students can use to practise translating
English words to German. It's flawed in a great number of ways, most notably
by using a static list of words to translate, which is repeated in the same
order on every run: run a chapter more than a few times and you end up simply
memorizing the order of the words, not learning them.

Vokab is an attempt to do better. When the program is launched, several words with
the highest scores are displayed in English, and the user must enter their
German translations. If the German is incorrect, the correct translation is
shown. The score is computed based on the Wilson score; the selection criteria
are described in detail in the L<internals docs|doc/word-selection.md>.
